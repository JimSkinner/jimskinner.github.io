      <description>I’m in the middle of producing an R package implementing a statistical model which finds a maximum-likelihood set of parameters \(\theta\) using Expectation Maximisation (EM). Implementing EM can be tricky, since bugs can have non-obvious consequences, such as converging to the wrong set of parameters or not converging at all. However, EM turns out to be very easy to write unit tests for.
In maximising the log posterior, EM iterates between two steps:</description>

      <title>Elegant linear algebra in R with the Matrix package</title>

      <description>The Matrix R package is a fantastic tool, allowing the user to construct structured matrices of different types (triangular, symmetric, sparse, etc). A common set of operations are offered for all types (\(+\), \(-\), solve, …), meaning differently typed matrices can all be treated the same. Importantly, the method of storage for each matrix type takes advantage of its structure, as do the operations on these matrices.
Below I construct 4 \(d\times d\) matrices of different types: general dense, positive semidefinite, sparse and symmetric sparse.</description>

      <description>I recently used this trick to obtain a 10x speedup on an R package I am working on, and was so happy with myself I thought I would share it.
Say we have a low-rank plus diagonal matrix \(\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^\top + \sigma^2\mathit{I}\) with \(d \times k\) matrix \(\mathbf{W}\) where \(d \gg k\). If we are interested in solving \(\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\) for another \(d\times d\) matrix \(\mathbf{A}\), this would normally be achieved by Cholesky-decomposing \(\mathbf{C}\) then using forward/back-substitution to solve the system.</description>
