      <description>The Matrix R package is a fantastic tool, allowing the user to construct structured matrices of different types (triangular, symmetric, sparse, etc). A common set of operations are offered for all types (\(+\), \(-\), solve, …), meaning differently typed matrices can all be treated the same. Importantly, the method of storage for each matrix type takes advantage of its structure, as do the operations on these matrices.
Below I construct 4 \(d\times d\) matrices of different types: general dense, positive semidefinite, sparse and symmetric sparse.</description>
