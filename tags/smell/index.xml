      <description>I have just submitted my thesis! In celebration, hereâ€™s a brief, hopefully interesting description of the application I was working on: disease diagnosis using artificial olfaction (smell).
It turns out that humans can, with training, diagnose disease using smell, and have been doing this for thousands of years. This was certainly done by Hippocrates around 400BC, who wrote in the book Aphorisms1 about using the smell of urine, and spit after being vaporised on hot coals, to inform diagnoses.</description>
