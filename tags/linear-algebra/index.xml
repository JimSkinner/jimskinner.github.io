      <description>The Matrix R package is a fantastic tool, allowing the user to construct structured matrices of different types (triangular, symmetric, sparse, etc). A common set of operations are offered for all types (\(+\), \(-\), solve, …), meaning differently typed matrices can all be treated the same. Importantly, the method of storage for each matrix type takes advantage of its structure, as do the operations on these matrices.
Below I construct 4 \(d\times d\) matrices of different types: general dense, positive semidefinite, sparse and symmetric sparse.</description>

      <description>I recently used this trick to obtain a 10x speedup on an R package I am working on, and was so happy with myself I thought I would share it.
Say we have a low-rank plus diagonal matrix \(\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^\top + \sigma^2\mathit{I}\) with \(d \times k\) matrix \(\mathbf{W}\) where \(d \gg k\). If we are interested in solving \(\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\) for another \(d\times d\) matrix \(\mathbf{A}\), this would normally be achieved by Cholesky-decomposing \(\mathbf{C}\) then using forward/back-substitution to solve the system.</description>
